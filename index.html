            Hey, I’m EchoBoy—a new artist diving into expressive, moody soundscapes. My first release was an instrumental that hints at my style. <br>I’ve also written a song called Echoes of Goodbye, which I’m gearing up to record soon. <br>Another track, Gravity, is in the works, and I’m thrilled to see it take shape. <br>This is just the start of my journey, and I can’t wait to share every part of it with you!

            <h3>Echoes of Goodbye</h3>
            <p class="bordered-paragraph">“Echoes of Goodbye” is a pensive song that tells a story of love lost and the melancholy recollections that come with it. This composition creates the essence of a room empty yet full with memories of the darling, <br>heard only through the echoes of their name that have no end. The captivating tune, after telling a story of love and bliss quickly brought to an end, accentuates these melancholy feelings, <br>showing the difficulty one goes through whilst trying to let go and move on. It clarifies the point that even as the memory of a love-filled past fades, some of it is stored in the living heart as echoes.</p>

            <h3>Upcoming: Gravity</h3>
            <p class="bordered-paragraph">The narrative depicted in the song 'Gravity' manages to capture the essence of being in love. A peculiar body of attraction reunites the narrator with a certain special one. <br>These lines demonstrate a sense of inevitability, and they juxtapose the power of love and levity together. In the course of the song, the notions come full-circle, <br>and we realize that one cannot argue but admit love is truly overpowering. Thus, love is made grand in "Gravity" and lets us know to fall for someone is, actually, a good thing to do.</p>
